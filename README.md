## **Description**
My goal for this challenge was to review the code presented to me for a company called Horiseon. I had to review the code to improve its semantic structure, refactor the html section and css section and make the code easier to read for maintainability.

## **Corrections**
- Gave the title section a descriptive title
- Fixed search engine optimization link in navigation bar to properly redirect to correct section on the page
- Replaced several div tags with correct tags to follow semantic structure
- Added alt tags to images to describe the images and commented html and css section for ease of accessibility
- Modified main section and sidebar section classes to consolidate css code to make it more concise

## **Technologies**
- HTML
- CSS

## **Preview**
After all of the changes I made the website still looks like how it did before I modified the code.
